## PROPOSAL
### TallyHome - Catalog your home improvements/milestones
Many times throughout my home-ownership history I would think to myself (or an insurance adjuster!) something to the effect of: “When did I update the roof again? Who installed it? What kind of shingles did we get again? How long is the warranty good for?” and would throw my hands in the air and throw a nearly random year number out there. I thought to myself, wouldn’t it be nice to have a way to keep track of things like this?  
This was the catalyst for **TallyHome**.

### TallyHome Snapshot
-   TallyHome is basically a diary of milestones for your residence.
-   Use it to track known and best-guess milestones:
    -   Moved in. New Refridgerator. New Roof. Previous owners replaced pipes. Flooded basement. Child moved to 2nd floor. Got Google Fiber. Etcetera.
-   Attach helpful documentation for future use: 
    -   Total cost, receipts, warranty, insurance information, appliance life-cycle expectancy, applicable images of milestone
